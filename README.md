# ♟️ Chess System ♟️

This project is a Java implementation of a Chess game. The development of the Chess system required the application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

<details>
  <summary><b>OOP Principles Implemented</b></summary>

- **Classes:** Structured the program using classes to encapsulate behavior and data related to different components.

- **Abstract Classes/Methods:** Utilized abstract classes and methods to define a blueprint for common functionalities shared among multiple classes.

- **Encapsulation:** Applied encapsulation to restrict access to certain components and promote a more secure and organized codebase.

- **Inheritance:** Leveraged inheritance to establish relationships between classes, promoting code reuse and extensibility.

- **Polymorphism:** Implemented polymorphism to allow objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class, enhancing flexibility and adaptability.

- **Downcasting:** Utilized downcasting to access specific functionalities of derived classes when working with objects at the base class level.

  <summary><b>Other OOP Concepts Applied</b></summary>

- **Exceptions:** Managed exceptions to handle unexpected situations gracefully and ensure the robustness of the Chess system.

- **List:** Employed lists to store and manipulate collections of elements efficiently.

- **Matrix:** Utilized matrices to represent the chessboard and facilitate the implementation of game logic.

- **Overloading:** Implemented method overloading to create multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

- **Layers pattern:** Adopted the layers pattern to organize the application into logical layers, promoting separation of concerns and maintainability.

- **Static members:** Incorporated static members to define properties and methods that belong to the class rather than instances, providing a global scope.
